# Jelly's Dotfiles
This git  repo contains my dotfiles for popular software like mplayer,vim,xmonad,xmobar,newsbeuter and rxvt. 


## Bin
The bin directory contains some usefull scripts that i made in the past. 
* flashvideo - plays a flash video loaded in firefox with mplayer 
* mplayer.tv - a script to start mplayer on my TV instead of my dual monitor setup
* SeperateX - creates a seperate X  session for games

### Archlinux Scripts
Both oldbugs and unassignedbugs are two python scripts that are usefull for bug assigning work. The first script mails me a list of bugs that are openend since a custom date. This date can be defined in config.cfg, default_config.cfg is an example config file. 

Unassignedbugs, is a script that emails me all the unassigned bugs on Archlinux's bugtracker.
